## Key Improvements in Revised Questions

1. **Q1 (Why God forbade the tree):** Now asks for deeper understanding of relationship/trust, not just obedience

2. **Q2 (How snake tricked them):** Focuses on manipulation and deception as teaching about false friendship

3. **Q3 (Why they left Eden):** Teaches about original sin and separation from God (not just punishment)

4. **Q5 (Why God created them):** Reframed from obedience to stewardship and caring for creation

5. **Q6-Q10 (Noah):** Emphasizes trust despite ridicule, protecting the faithful, universal kindness

6. **Q11-Q15 (Moses):** Standing up for oppressed, patience with resistant, defending vulnerable

7. **Q16-Q20 (Jesus):** Resisting temptation when weak, staying true when pressured

8. **Q21 (Assessment):** Changed from listing kindness acts to comparing kindness vs. selfishness with Biblical examples

## Central Theme Throughout

Every question now circles back to the core theme:
**"Is it better to be kind and obey God, or is it better to be selfish?"**
